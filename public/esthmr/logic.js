      revPeBody:'Market value divided by profit: how much you pay for each pound the company earns. A falling P/E can mean the price got cheaper or the earnings got better — those are different stories. Rising with fast growth can mean the market is paying for what comes next; rising with flat growth is a stretch. Never read it without the earnings line below it.',
      revPbBody:'Market value divided by shareholders\' equity. Below 1 means the market values the company under its accounting equity — which is only a bargain if the assets are productive. Read it beside return on equity: low price to book with a high return is a different company from low price to book with a poor one.',
      revYieldBody:'The annual dividend against the share price, as the exchange publishes it. A yield can climb simply because the price collapsed, and a company paying out heavily may be keeping too little to invest. Read it beside profit and debt.',
      revProfitBody:'What the company filed as profit for the full year, as the exchange received it. Direction is read from the sign of each year\'s move rather than a percentage, because a percentage off a loss is meaningless: going from a loss to a profit is not growth of some number, it is a company that stopped losing money.',
      revEpsBody:'Profit divided by the shares in issue. This is the number that survives a company issuing more shares: total profit can climb while each share earns less. When you hear that profits increased, this is the follow-up question.',
      revAssetsBody:'What the company holds, from its filed balance sheet. This stands in for revenue growth, which no Egyptian source publishes: assets growing while profit does not is the same warning a falling margin would give — the company is putting more in to get the same out.',
      revCashBody:'Operating cash flow divided by reported profit. Above 1 means the company collected more cash than it booked as profit. This stands in for profit margin, which needs revenue nobody publishes — and it arguably answers the question better: when profit climbs and the cash does not follow, that is the thing worth investigating.',
      revRoeBody:'Profit as a share of shareholders\' equity: how much the company earns on the money its owners left in it. A high return is not automatically impressive — debt shrinks equity, which lifts the ratio without the business improving. Always read it beside debt to equity.',
      revRoaBody:'Profit as a share of total assets. Unlike return on equity, borrowing cannot flatter it — the assets stay on the books either way. The gap between the two is roughly how much of the return is coming from leverage.',
      revDebtBody:'Total liabilities against shareholders\' equity. The absolute amount of debt says surprisingly little: a company owing ten billion can be sounder than one owing one, depending on the size of the business behind it. Rising debt is not automatically a problem either — what matters is what moved alongside it. Debt up a fifth while earnings rose by half is borrowed money doing work. Debt up by four fifths while profit crept 5% is the case to look at.',
      revOrientPe:'Lower is the cheaper side. A P/E below its sector means you pay less than for similar companies for the same profit; above its sector means you pay more. Watch one thing: a very low reading can also mean the market expects the profit to drop.',
      revOrientPb:'Lower is the cheaper side. Below its sector means you pay less for each pound of the company\'s book value than its peers do; above its sector means more. A very low reading can also flag assets the market doubts are worth what the books say.',
      revOrientYield:'Higher pays you more. Above its sector means more cash back each year per pound than its peers pay; below its sector means less. But a very high yield often comes from a share price that has dropped, or a payout that may be cut — so higher is not always steadier.',
      revOrientHigherMore:'Higher is simply more — more profit, or more earnings for each share. Above its sector means more than its peers, but the direction over time matters most: rising reads better than falling.',
      revOrientCash:'Higher is healthier. Above its sector means more of the reported profit actually arrived as cash than for its peers — money in the bank, not just profit on paper; below its sector means more of it is still on paper.',
      revOrientReturn:'Higher is the stronger side. Above its sector means the company turns each pound put into it into more profit than its peers do; below its sector is weaker. Steady-and-high reads better than high-but-jumpy.',
      revOrientDebt:'Lower is the safer side. Below its sector means the company has borrowed less against its own money than its peers; above its sector carries more debt — which can fund growth but adds risk if conditions tighten.',
      revOrientAssets:'Higher just means bigger — more owned than its peers, nothing more. Size only counts if those assets earn a return, which the profit and return rows show; bigger is not automatically stronger.',

   * H1 and 9M filings, where the label names an end and says nothing about
   * where the count began.
